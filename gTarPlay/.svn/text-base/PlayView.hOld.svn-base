// This class is completely empty, but unfortunately still necesary.
// Xcode apparently doesn't load the EAGLView "binary" from the static library
// if it doesn't think it needs it. As a result, XIBs created in IB are throwing
// "EAGLView class not found", presumably because Xcode didn't think anyone was ever
// creating these classes. 
//
// As a test, if I randomly call [EAGLView alloc] somewhere in the code, all of a sudden
// the IB XIBs work just fine and no crashes. I'm not sure of any better way to 
// force Xcode to include the EAGLView "binary", so creating a dummy subclass
// is the better of two ugly solutions.
